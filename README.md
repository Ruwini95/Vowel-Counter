# Vowel-Counter
Program to count the frequency of vowels.

This program counts the frequency (number of times) of each vowel character ( a, e, i, o,u ) occur in a sentence entered by the user.Once the output is printed it asks the user whether he wish to add another sentence or not.

If yes get the input sentence,else quit the program.

I am using a dictionary to store te frequencies.
